# rclone-Python-GUI
This is a python script that interacts with the rclone.exe file in an attempt to avoid having to type out commands. This is in very early stages, and doesn't even do many of the rclone functions. This is not made for public use, I'm just making it as a fun side project and to help increase my coding experience.
